This is a local clone of the Laxy Travel Webflow site.

## Project Structure

## Local Development

You can view the site by opening `index.html` in any web browser. For the best experience, use a local development server like VS Code Live Server.

## Tidying Up Notes

- Webflow-specific meta tags and data attributes have been removed.
- Assets have been organized into a structured directory.
